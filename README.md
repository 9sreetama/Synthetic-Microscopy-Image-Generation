# Synthetic-Microscopy-Image-Generation

This is a MATLAB code to create synthetic microscopy images mimicking the usual distortion and noise added during actually  image acquasition. These reference ground truth images can used for parameter optimisation, algorithm performance evaluation and comparison. The workflow of the synthetic image generation is illustrated in the figure below.
